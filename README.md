# OFQT

# DEPRECATED - NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL

The OpenFortress Team has remove their TVN/Toast servers so there is no way to use this program in its intended way.

Its unlikely that I will port this to their new system because it relies on torrents, previously metalink, and a custom format developed by itch.io with no bindings available to my knowledge.

I recommend others do not attempt to port this program to their never system because it is unlikely to stay around in the long term.
